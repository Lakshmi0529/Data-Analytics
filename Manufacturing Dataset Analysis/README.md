This project analyzes the Manufacturing dataset of Adventure works.

The objective is to get key insights into the raw data which consists of sales by region and territory, customers data, product and product
category data.

Technical tools used are Python (SQLAlchemy library), POWER BI for visualization, and Excel.

Data cleaning and transformation are done using Python. I used SQLAlchemy library to get a hang of SQL in Python, though I use SSMS regularly I
found SQL in Python to be much more efficient and was fun ( Querying and converting queries to dataframes, converting tables to dataframes to leverage
Pandas in Python)

Check the Python code for more info.
